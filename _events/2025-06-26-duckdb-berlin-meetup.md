We are excited to announce the DuckDB Berlin meetup, which will take place during the week of the [SIGMOD 2025 conference](https://2025.sigmod.org/).
Every year, SIGMOD attracts hundreds of database researchers, some of whom already use [DuckDB in their scientific work](https://shows.acast.com/disseminate). The DuckDB meetup will feature two talks from researchers and one from industry practitioners.

The meetup will be held at the [Dorint Kurfürstendamm Berlin](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Fv2WhXUJ7F5CLNTm6), less than 20 minutes walking distance from SIGMOD's venue.
