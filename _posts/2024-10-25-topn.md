## Introduction to Top N

A common pattern when analyzing data is to look for the rows of data that are the highest or lowest in a particular metric.
When interested in the highest or lowest `N` rows in an entire dataset, SQL's standard `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses will sort by the metric of interest and only return `N` rows.
For example, using the scale factor 1 (SF1) data set of the [TPC-H benchmark]({% link docs/stable/core_extensions/tpch.md %}):

```sql
INSTALL tpch;
LOAD tpch;
-- Generate an example TPC-H dataset
CALL dbgen(sf = 1);

-- Return the most recent 3 rows by l_shipdate
FROM lineitem
ORDER BY
    l_shipdate DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

| l_orderkey | l_partkey | ... | l_shipmode | l_comment                           |
| ---------: | --------: | --- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
|     354528 |      6116 | ... | MAIL       | wake according to the u             |
|     413956 |     16402 | ... | SHIP       | usual patterns. carefull            |
|     484581 |     10970 | ... | TRUCK      | ccounts maintain. dogged accounts a |

This is useful to quickly get the oldest or newest values in a dataset or to find outliers in a particular metric.

Another common approach is to query the min/max summary statistics of one or more columns.
This can find outliers, but the row that contains the outlier can be different for each column, so it is answering a different question.
DuckDB's helpful `COLUMNS` expression allows us to calculate the maximum value for all columns.

```sql
FROM lineitem
SELECT
    max(COLUMNS(*));
```

> The queries in this post make extensive use of DuckDB's [`FROM`-first syntax]({% link docs/stable/sql/query_syntax/from.md %}#from-first-syntax).
> This allows the `FROM` and `SELECT` clauses to be swapped, and it even allows omitting the latter entirely.

| l_orderkey | l_partkey | ... | l_shipmode | l_comment   |
| ---------: | --------: | --- | ---------- | ----------- |
|     600000 |     20000 | ... | TRUCK      | zzle. slyly |

However, these two approaches can only answer certain kinds of questions.
There are many scenarios where the goal is to understand the top N values _within a group_.
In the first example above, how would we calculate the last 10 shipments from each supplier?
SQL's `LIMIT` clause is not able to handle that situation.
Let's call this type of analysis the top N by group.

This type of analysis is a common tool for exploring new datasets.
Use cases include pulling the most recent few rows for each group or finding the most extreme few values in a group.
Sticking with our shipment example, we could look at the last 10 shipments of each part number, or find the 5 highest priced orders per customer.

## Traditional Top N by Group

In most databases, the way to filter to the top N within a group is to use a [window function]({% link docs/stable/sql/functions/window_functions.md %}) and a [common table expression (CTE)]({% link docs/stable/sql/query_syntax/with.md %}).
This approach also works in DuckDB.
For example, this query returns the 3 most recent shipments for each supplier:

```sql
WITH ranked_lineitem AS (
    FROM lineitem
    SELECT
        *,
        row_number() OVER
            (PARTITION BY l_suppkey ORDER BY l_shipdate DESC)
            AS my_ranking
)
FROM ranked_lineitem
WHERE
    my_ranking <= 3;
```

| l_orderkey | l_partkey | l_suppkey | ... | l_shipmode | l_comment                                 | my_ranking |
| ---------: | --------: | --------: | --- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------: |

In DuckDB, this can be simplified using the [`QUALIFY` clause]({% link docs/stable/sql/query_syntax/qualify.md %}).
`QUALIFY` acts like a `WHERE` clause, but specifically operates on the results of window functions.
By making this adjustment, the CTE can be avoided while returning the same results.

```sql
FROM lineitem
SELECT
    *,
    row_number() OVER
        (PARTITION BY l_suppkey ORDER BY l_shipdate DESC)
        AS my_ranking
QUALIFY
    my_ranking <= 3;
```

This is certainly a viable approach!
However, what are its weaknesses?
Even though the query is interested in only the 3 most recent shipments, it must sort every shipment just to retrieve those top 3.
Sorting in DuckDB has a complexity of `O(kn)` due to DuckDB's innovative [Radix sort implementation]({% post_url 2021-08-27-external-sorting %}), but this is still higher than the `O(n)` of [DuckDB's hash aggregate]({% post_url 2024-03-29-external-aggregation %}), for example.
Sorting is also a memory intensive operation when compared with aggregation.

## Top N in DuckDB

[DuckDB 1.1]({% post_url 2024-09-09-announcing-duckdb-110 %}) added a new capability to dramatically simplify and improve performance of top N calculations.
Namely, the functions `min`, `max`, `min_by`, and `max_by` all now accept an optional parameter `N`.
If `N` is greater than 1 (the default), they will return an array of the top values.

As a simple example, let's query the most recent (top 3) shipment dates:

```sql
FROM lineitem
SELECT
    max(l_shipdate, 3) AS top_3_shipdates;
```

| top_3_shipdates                      |
| ------------------------------------ |
| [1998-12-01, 1998-12-01, 1998-12-01] |

## Top N by Column in DuckDB

The top N selection can become even more useful thanks to the `COLUMNS` expression once again â€“ we can retrieve the 3 top values in each column.
We can call this a _top N by column analysis._
It is particularly messy to try to do this analysis with ordinary SQL!
You would need a subquery or window function for every single column...
In DuckDB, simply:

```sql
FROM lineitem
SELECT
    max(COLUMNS(*), 3) AS "top_3_\0";
```

| top_3_l_orderkey         | top_3_l_partkey       | ... | top_3_l_shipmode      | top_3_l_comment                                                              |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | --- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [600000, 600000, 599975] | [20000, 20000, 20000] | ... | [TRUCK, TRUCK, TRUCK] | [zzle. slyly, zzle. quickly bold a, zzle. pinto beans boost slyly slyly fin] |

## Top N by Group in DuckDB

Armed with the new `N` parameter, how can we speed up a top N by group analysis?

Want to cut to the chase and see the final output?
[Feel free to skip ahead!](#the-final-top-n-by-group-query)

We will take advantage of three other DuckDB SQL features to make this possible:

- The [`max_by` function]({% link docs/stable/sql/functions/aggregates.md %}#max_byarg-val-n) (also known as `arg_max`)
- The [`unnest` function]({% link docs/stable/sql/query_syntax/unnest.md %})
- Automatically packing an entire row into a [`STRUCT` column]({% link docs/stable/sql/data_types/struct.md %}#creating-structs)

The `max` function will return the max (or now the max N!) of a specific column.
In contrast, the `max_by` function will find the maximum value in a column, and then retrieve a value from the same row, but a different column.
For example, this query will return the ids of the 3 most recently shipped orders for each supplier:

```sql
FROM lineitem
SELECT
    l_suppkey,
    max_by(l_orderkey, l_shipdate, 3) AS recent_orders
GROUP BY
    l_suppkey;
```

| l_suppkey | recent_orders               |
| --------: | --------------------------- |
|      2992 | [233573, 3597639, 3060227]  |
|      8516 | [4675968, 5431174, 4626530] |
|      3205 | [3844610, 4396966, 3405255] |
|      2152 | [1672000, 4209601, 3831138] |
|      1880 | [4852999, 2863747, 1650084] |
|       ... | ...                         |

The `max_by` function is an aggregate function, so it takes advantage of DuckDB's fast hash aggregation rather than sorting.
Instead of sorting by `l_shipdate`, the `max_by` function scans through the dataset just once and keeps track of the `N` highest `l_shipdate` values.
It then returns the order id that corresponds with each of the most recent shipment dates.
The radix sort in DuckDB must scan through the dataset once per byte, so scanning only once provides a significant speedup.
For example, if sorting by a 64-bit integer, the sort algorithm must loop through the dataset 8 times vs. 1 with this approach!
A simple micro-benchmark is included in the [Performance Comparisons](#performance-comparisons) section.

However, this SQL query has a few gaps.
The query returns results as a `LIST` rather than as separate rows.
Thankfully the `unnest` function can split a `LIST` into separate rows:

```sql
FROM lineitem
SELECT
    l_suppkey,
    unnest(
        max_by(l_orderkey, l_shipdate, 3)
    ) AS recent_orders
GROUP BY
    l_suppkey;
```

| l_suppkey | recent_orders |
| --------: | ------------: |
|      2576 |        930468 |
|      2576 |       2248354 |
|      2576 |       3640711 |
|      5559 |       4022148 |
|      5559 |       1675680 |
|      5559 |       4976259 |
|       ... |           ... |

The next gap is that there is no way to easily see the `l_shipdate` associated with the returned `l_orderkey` values.
This query only returns a single column, while typically a top N by group analysis will require the entire row.

Fortunately, DuckDB allows us to refer to the entire contents of a row as if it were just a single column!
By referring to the name of the table itself (here, `lineitem`) instead of the name of a column, the `max_by` function can retrieve all columns.

```sql
FROM lineitem
SELECT
    l_suppkey,
    unnest(
        max_by(lineitem, l_shipdate, 3)
    ) AS recent_orders
GROUP BY
    l_suppkey;
```

| l_suppkey | recent_orders                                                       |
| --------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|      5411 | {'l_orderkey': 2543618, 'l_partkey': 105410, 'l_suppkey': 5411, ... |
|      5411 | {'l_orderkey': 580547, 'l_partkey': 130384, 'l_suppkey': 5411, ...  |
|      5411 | {'l_orderkey': 3908642, 'l_partkey': 132897, 'l_suppkey': 5411, ... |
|        90 | {'l_orderkey': 4529697, 'l_partkey': 122553, 'l_suppkey': 90, ...   |
|        90 | {'l_orderkey': 4473346, 'l_partkey': 160089, 'l_suppkey': 90, ...   |
|       ... | ...                                                                 |

Let's make that a bit friendlier looking by splitting the `STRUCT` out into separate columns to match our original dataset.

### The Final Top N by Group Query

Passing in one more argument to `UNNEST` will split this out into separate columns by running recursively.
In this case, that means that `UNNEST` will run twice: once to convert each `LIST` into separate rows, and then again to convert each `STRUCT` into separate columns.
The `l_suppkey` column can also be excluded, since it will automatically be included already.

```sql
FROM lineitem
SELECT
    unnest(
        max_by(lineitem, l_shipdate, 3),
        recursive := 1
    ) AS recent_orders
GROUP BY
    l_suppkey;
```

| l_orderkey | l_partkey | l_suppkey | ... | l_shipinstruct    | l_shipmode | l_comment                             |
| ---------: | --------: | --------: | --- | ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |

We now have a way to use an aggregate function to calculate the top N rows per group!
So, how much more efficient is it?

## Performance Comparisons

We will compare the `QUALIFY` approach with the `max_by` approach for solving the top N by group problem.
We have discussed both queries, but for reference they are repeated below.

<details markdown='1'>
<summary markdown='span'>
    `QUALIFY` query:
</summary>

```sql
FROM lineitem
SELECT
    *,
    row_number() OVER
        (PARTITION BY l_suppkey ORDER BY l_shipdate DESC)
        AS my_ranking
QUALIFY
    my_ranking <= 3;
```

</details>

<details markdown='1'>
<summary markdown='span'>
    `max_by` query:
</summary>

```sql
FROM lineitem
SELECT
    unnest(
        max_by(lineitem, l_shipdate, 3),
        recursive := 1
    )
GROUP BY
    l_suppkey;
```

</details>

While the main query is running, we will also kick off a background thread to periodically measure DuckDB's memory use.
This uses the built in table function `duckdb_memory()` and includes information about Memory usage as well as temporary disk usage.
The small Python script used for benchmarking is included below the results.
The machine used for benchmarking was an M1 MacBook Pro with 16 GB RAM.

|  SF | `max_memory` |       Metric | `QUALIFY` | `max_by` | Improvement |
| --: | -----------: | -----------: | --------: | -------: | ----------: |
|   1 |      Default |   Total time |    0.58 s |   0.24 s | 2.4Ã—        |
|   5 |      Default |   Total time |    6.15 s |   1.26 s | 4.9Ã—        |
|  10 |        36 GB |   Total time |    36.8 s |   25.4 s | 1.4Ã—        |
|   1 |      Default | Memory usage |    1.7 GB |   0.2 GB | 8.5Ã—        |
|   5 |      Default | Memory usage |    7.9 GB |   1.5 GB | 5.3Ã—        |
|  10 |        36 GB | Memory usage |   15.7 GB |  17.1 GB | 0.9Ã—        |

We can see that in each of these situations, the `max_by` approach is faster, in some cases nearly 5Ã— faster!
However, as the data grows larger, the `max_by` approach begins to weaken relative to `QUALIFY`.

In some cases, the memory use is significantly lower with `max_by` also.
However, the memory use of the `max_by` approach becomes more significant as scale increases, because the number of distinct `l_suppkey` values increases linearly with the scale factor.
This increased memory use likely explains the performance decrease, as both algorithms approached the maximum amount of RAM on my machine and began to swap to disk.

In order to reduce the memory pressure, let's re-run the scale factor 10 (SF10) benchmark using fewer threads (4 threads and 1 thread).
We continue to use a `max_memory` setting of 36 GB.
The prior SF10 results with all 10 threads are included for reference.

|  SF | Threads |       Metric | `QUALIFY` | `max_by` | Improvement |
| --: | ------: | -----------: | --------: | -------: | ----------: |
|  10 |      10 |   Total time |    36.8 s |   25.4 s | 1.4Ã—        |
|  10 |       4 |   Total time |    49.0 s |   21.0 s | 2.3Ã—        |
|  10 |       1 |   Total time |   115.7 s |   12.7 s | 9.1Ã—        |
|  10 |      10 | Memory usage |   15.7 GB |  17.1 GB | 0.9Ã—        |
|  10 |       4 | Memory usage |   15.9 GB |  17.3 GB | 0.9Ã—        |
|  10 |       1 | Memory usage |   14.5 GB |   1.8 GB | 8.1Ã—        |

The `max_by` approach is so computationally efficient that even with 1 thread it is dramatically faster than the `QUALIFY` approach that uses all 10 threads!
Reducing the thread count very effectively lowered the memory use as well (a nearly 10Ã— reduction).

So, when should we use each?
As with all database things, _it depends!_
If memory is constrained, `max_by` may also offer benefits, especially when the thread count is tuned to avoid spilling to disk.
However, if there are approximately as many groups as there are rows, consider `QUALIFY` since we lose some of the memory efficiency of the `max_by` approach.

## Conclusion

DuckDB now offers a convenient way to calculate the top N values of both `min` and `max` aggregate functions, as well as their advanced cousins `min_by` and `max_by`.
They are easy to get started with, and also enable more complex analyses like calculating the top N for all columns or the top N by group.
There are also possible performance benefits when compared with a window function approach.

We would love to hear about the creative ways you are able to use this new feature!

Happy analyzing!
