Our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb) has just passed 30&nbsp;000 stars.

TODO: snapshot image of star-history

We would like to use this event to stop for a moment and reflect on recent advancements in the DuckDB ecosystem since last December, when
we reached [25&nbsp;000 stars]({% post_url 2024-12-16-github-25k-stars %}).

* [release of 1.3.0]({% post_url 2025-05-21-announcing-duckdb-130 %})
* [ducklake](https://ducklake.select/), read the [blog post]({% post_url 2025-05-27-ducklake %})
* [UI]({% post_url 2025-03-12-duckdb-ui %})
* Iceberg Rest catalog support
* [published a roadmap]({% link roadmap.md %})

third party:

* smallpond release

Besides the GitHub stars we have also observed a lot of growth in various metrics.

* Each month, our website handles over 3 million unique visitors – more than double than what we have seen . In addition, we see over XXXX TB in traffic from ca. XXXX million extension downloads. Thanks again to Cloudflare for [sponsoring the project]({% link foundation/index.html %}#technical-sponsors) with free content delivery services!
* Just in this calendar year, we rose 10 positions in the [DB Engines ranking](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking) from position 55 to 45.
* We count [22M+ monthly downloads in PyPI](https://pypistats.org/packages/duckdb).

* events
We hosted the first livestreamed DuckCon in [Amsterdam]({% link _events/2025-01-31-duckcon6.md %}) and organized another [DuckDB Meetup]({% link _events/2025-02-20-duckdb-amsterdam-meetup-2.md %}).


We would like to reiterate that while we’re happy to see these numbers grow, we are not glorifying them and they are not a target per se in accordance with [Goodhart’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law).
