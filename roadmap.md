## Overview

The DuckDB project is governed by the [non-profit DuckDB Foundation]({% link foundation/index.html %}).
The Foundation and [DuckDB Labs](https://duckdblabs.com) are not funded by external investors (e.g., venture capital).
Instead, the Foundation is funded by contributions from its [members]({% link foundation/index.html %}#supporters),
while DuckDB Labs' revenue is based on [commercial support and feature prioritization services](https://duckdblabs.com/#support).

## Planned Features (Last Updated: May 2025)

This section lists the features that the DuckDB team plans to work on **in the coming year**.

* Documentation for the [C extension API](https://github.com/duckdb/extension-template-c)
* Generic ODBC catalog, similarly to the existing PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite integrations
* Go and Rust support for extensions
* **Data lake formats**
    * Improved support for the Iceberg format through the [iceberg extension]({% link docs/stable/core_extensions/iceberg/overview.md %})
    * Improved support for Delta Lake through the [delta extension]({% link docs/stable/core_extensions/delta.md %})
    * (Update 2025-05-27:) We released [DuckLake](https://ducklake.select/), a lakehouse format. We would like to emphasize that we are still committed to develop both DuckDB's Iceberg and Delta Lake extensions, including adding write support for these formats.
* [`MATCH RECOGNIZE`](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/discussions/3994) for pattern matching
* Remote file content caching using buffer manager (e.g., when querying Parquet files on S3)
* [Database file encryption](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/discussions/4512)
* Distribution of musl libc binaries

This list was compiled by the DuckDB maintainers and is based on the long-term strategic vision for the DuckDB project and general interactions with users in the open-source community (GitHub Issues and Discussions, social media, etc.).
For details on how to request features in DuckDB, please refer to the FAQ item [“I would like feature X to be implemented in DuckDB”]({% link faq.md %}#i-would-like-feature-x-to-be-implemented-in-duckdb-how-do-i-proceed).

Please note that there are **no guarantees** that a particular feature will be released within the next year. Everything on this page is subject to change without notice.
